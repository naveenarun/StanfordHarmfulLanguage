# Stanford Harmful Language Initiative Dataset

**Content Warning: This page contains language that is offensive or harmful. Please engage with this page at your own pace.**

This repository contains tabulated data from Stanford's [Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative](https://itcommunity.stanford.edu/news/introducing-elimination-harmful-language-initiative-website). The data was accessed from a [December 19, 2022 snapshot](http://web.archive.org/web/20221219160303/https://itcommunity.stanford.edu/ehli) of the site, which has since been mirrored by various media outlets including the [Wall Street Journal](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/stanfordlanguage.pdf). The purpose of this repository is to present the data from the website in machine-readable format.

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed [here](Stanford_harmful_language_dataset.csv) and downloaded with [this link](https://github.com/naveenarun/StanfordHarmfulLanguage/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). A sample of the data is shown below:

| Category | Instead of  | Consider using                       | Context                                                                                                       |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ableist  | addict      | person with a substance use disorder | Using person-first language helps to not define people by just one of their characteristics.                  |
| Ableist  | addicted    | hooked                               | Trivializes the experiences of people who deal with substance abuse issues.                                   |
| Ableist  | addicted    | devoted                              | Trivializes the experiences of people who deal with substance abuse issues.                                   |
| Ableist  | basket case | nervous                              | Originally referred to one who has lost all four limbs and therefore needed to be carried around in a basket. |

As shown above, the "Instead of" column can contain repeated values - the word "addicted" shows up twice because it may be replaced with the words "hooked" or "devoted".

Similarly, the "Consider using" column may contain repeated values; for example in the following snippet, the word "hooray" can be used as a replacement for either "hip-hip hurray" or "hip hip hooray".

| Category                  | Instead of     | Consider using | Context                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Additional Considerations | hip-hip hurray | hooray         | This term was used by German citizens during the Holocaust as a rallying cry when they would hunt down Jewish citizens living in segregated neighborhoods. |

Raw data extracted from the site can be found in the [raw/](raw/raw.csv) folder.

## Contributing

The dataset was generated by extracting the raw data using the [Table Capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/table-capture/iebpjdmgckacbodjpijphcplhebcmeop/related?hl=en) plugin for Chrome, passing it into Pandas, and expanding many-to-one relationships into one-to-one relationships (e.g. expanding entries such as **"addicted" -> "hooked/devoted"** into **"addicted" -> "hooked"** and **"addicted" -> "devoted"**). Some of the data may not have been extracted/reformatted properly, or could be expanded further. Some of the rows had to be manually edited to handle edge cases.

If you find any issues with the data or would like to tidy it further, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/naveenarun/StanfordHarmfulLanguage/pulls) with your revisions.
